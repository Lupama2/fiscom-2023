# FISCOM 2023

## Teaching of Computational Physics

At 2023 I worked as Assistant Professor in Computational Physics taught at the Balseiro Institute. I use this repository to store the material used in the course and the exercises proposed to the students. Also, I use it to help students solve their bugs and to share the solutions of the exercises. The course is taught in Spanish, so the material is in Spanish.


## Instalation and requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need Python 3.7 or higher. You can install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also, you need to install the following packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `jupyter` and `ipython`.


First, please install Anaconda/Miniconda. Second, create a new environment and install the required packages. You can do it with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n fiscom python=3.8
conda activate fiscom
conda install numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn jupyter ipython
```
