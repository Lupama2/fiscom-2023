# FISCOM 2023

## Teaching of Computational Physics

In 2023, I served as an Assistant Professor in the Computational Physics course at the Balseiro Institute. This repository is used to store the course materials and the exercises assigned to students. Additionally, it serves as a platform to assist students in debugging their code and to share solutions to the exercises. The course is conducted in Spanish, and as such, the materials are also in Spanish.


## Instalation and Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you must have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, the following packages are required: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `jupyter` and `ipython`.

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Anaconda/Miniconda
2. Create a new environment and install the required packages. You can do it with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n fiscom python=3.8
conda activate fiscom
conda install numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn jupyter ipython
```
3. Recommended IDE: For working with Jupyter notebooks, I highly recommend installing Visual Studio Code (VSC). You can install it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
